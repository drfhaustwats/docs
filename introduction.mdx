# C/C++ Firmware Project

This documentation covers a comprehensive C/C++ firmware project designed to support two different microcontroller units (MCUs) with seamless Arduino component integration capabilities.

## Project Overview

Our firmware project provides a robust foundation for embedded development across multiple MCU platforms:

- **ESP32-H2 AT Firmware**: Advanced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LED control system with custom AT command support
- **ESP32-C5 WLED Firmware**: Full-featured LED lighting control system with web interface, effects engine, and extensive peripheral support

## Architecture

The project is structured to maximize code reuse while maintaining platform-specific optimizations:

### Dual MCU Support
- **ESP32-H2**: Optimized for BLE applications, AT command processing, and efficient LED control
- **ESP32-C5**: Feature-rich platform supporting web servers, advanced LED effects, and multiple communication protocols

### Arduino Component Integration
Our firmware seamlessly integrates Arduino ecosystem components, providing:
- **FastLED**: High-performance LED library support
- **AsyncTCP & ESPAsyncWebServer**: Non-blocking network communication
- **NeoPixelBus**: Advanced pixel control capabilities
- **Custom Components**: Specialized modules for AT command handling, settings management, and LED effects

## Key Features

- **Unified Component Architecture**: Shared libraries and utilities across both MCU platforms
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration of new Arduino libraries and custom components
- **Advanced LED Control**: Support for multiple LED protocols and complex lighting effects
